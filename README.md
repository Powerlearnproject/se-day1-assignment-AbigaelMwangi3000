Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. 
It is important as it enables trhe developmemt of operating systems,applications and even embedded systems which are important to the progression and betterment of the technology industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1940s-1950s- digital computers emerged
1960s- programming languages were developed
1970s- rise of structured programming
2000s- rise of agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
2. Design-Involves the designing of the software architecture and UI
3. Implementation- Involves the actual coding and building of the software
4. Testing- Conducting tests to ensure quality and functionality
5. Deployment- Testing the product on the users/customers
6. Maintenance- any services offered to improve the system after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology involves a sequential approach with dstinct phases in a sytematic way flowing down like a waterfall while Agile methodology is iteratie, flexible and focuses on collaboration and responding to change.
Waterfall is suitable for development that requires a specific structure and process while agile methodologies whould be suitable in scenarios where requiremnts keep changing.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-Writes code and implements software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer-Ensures quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager-ovesrees planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide tools that enable writing, debugging and testing of code, eg Visual Studio 
VCs enable one to track changes to source code as well as collaboration among team members, eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements- this can be solved by proper prior analysis and planning
Technical debt- can be solved by ensuring the quality of work input in everything is good to prevent future failure

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing- involves testing individual components or modules of software
Intergration Testing-Involves testing of interaction between different systems and subsystems
System Testing- Involves testing teh entire software system as a whole
Acceptance Testing- Involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to crafting of ones questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best possible answers from a robot or AI assistant
It is important as it helps get clearer and better quality responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague- Teach me steps of how to cook
Specific- Teach me the steps of how to cook Chicken periperi pizza
The improved prompt is more effective since it is specific, clear and concise and would give a better response from the robot or AI.
